# Site-Data

## About this repository
This public repository is a portal for basic site data for [CTFS-ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) sites.

It was initiated in July 2017 with data from [Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12712/abstract) and including sites that joined the network since that publication. 

## Contributing to this repository
We strongly encourage researchers in the CTFS-ForestGEO community to submit corrections/ updates and to contribute relevant new data to this repository.
